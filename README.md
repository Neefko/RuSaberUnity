ℹ️ RuSaber - Russian game created by *Filcher*, *Neefko* and *Teil1234*. <br>
💡 This game was inspired by BeatSaber. <br>
🖥 Our game can be played in VR, or on PC (if you are an individual)<br>
💖 This game is a project for **IT-Куб**, maybe we will like this project and we will develop it.

<h1 align="center">⭐ Idea</h1>
In this game our task is to cut the balls that appear depending on the beat in the music. In total, the game at the time of writing the README file has 2 maps with 2 different music.

<h1 align="center">⚔ Target</h1>
In our game we will create parody of BeatSaber, but instead of cube will sphere.
